### Investigated tools

> Please note: final comparison table will include only tools that were not rejected during investigation.

- .NET
  - :white_check_mark: [SelectPDF](https://selectpdf.com/)
  - :x: [PdfSharp](https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp) - it is in preview and requires some custom code or extension to perform transformation of HTML to PDF (community-proposed extension HtmlRenderer is not maintained anymore).
  - :white_check_mark: [IronPdf](https://ironpdf.com/)
  - :x: [DinkToPdf](https://github.com/rdvojmoc/DinkToPdf) - the package is outdated: latest update 18.2017.
  - :white_check_mark: [iTextSharp](https://github.com/itext/itextsharp)
  - :x: [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) - CLI that requires us to start additional process on a host. Besides there is a dependency on Qt WebKit.
  - :x: [PDFSharpCore](https://github.com/ststeiger/PdfSharpCore) - community-driven fork of PDFSharp that was transferred to a .NET Core. As well as the original library requires additional functionality to perform transformation.
  - :white_check_mark: [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf-framework/net/html-to-pdf)
  - :white_check_mark: [DynamicPDF](https://www.dynamicpdf.com/)
  - :white_check_mark: [PuppeteerSharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp)
  - :x: [NReco](https://www.nrecosite.com/pdf_generator_net.aspx) - paid wrapper library for wkhtmltopdf. Requires CLI tool to present on a machine.
- Node.js
  - :x: [html-pdf](https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf) - package is deprecated.
  - :grey_question: [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) - depends on a headless browser. It requires further investigation.
  - :x: [html2pdf.js](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js) - fully client-side library.

## Prototypes

Based on a comparison table, we have decided to perform further investigation and prototyping.

A list of selected tools contain:

- [iText](https://itextpdf.com/products/itext-7/convert-html-css-to-pdf-pdfhtml). According to a comparison table this is one of the most advanced tools for PDF generation.
- [NReco](https://www.nrecosite.com/pdf_generator_net.aspx). A .NET wrapper for wkhtmltopdf CLI tool. It is partially opposite of web browser based approaches and is very popular itself. Due these facts, we decided that it can be a good candidate for prototype.
- [PuppeteerSharp](https://www.puppeteersharp.com/). One of the most popular approaches, with a great community. Open-source and free.
- Custom wapper for [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/). Our own implementation of a wrapper provided in different libraries. It is a good candidate to estimate performance of tool as well as perform further investigations.
- [Weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/). Python based tooling that is open-source and has a great community.

For each of these tools, we have created a [prototype](/investigation/prototypes/) and performed benchmark to get main metrics. Besides benchmarking we will also estimate documentation and development effort to implement code.

> Benchmarking has been performed on [HTML inputs](/investigation/prototypes/PdfGenerator.Prototypes/benchmarks/Benchmarks/Stubs).

| Development effort                  | Medium effort. It is required to prepare Chromium browser that will be used during generation. It can be downloaded in code, but in future it should be prepared before running the application. | Minimal effort. Transformation code is easy to read and modify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Maximum effort. We had to setup separate process as well as configure CLI arguments and read the output.                                                           | Minimal effort.                                                                                                                                            |
| Testing potential                   | Weak potential for unit testing. At the same time, e2e-testing can be performed. The only thing to keep in mind is availability of Chromium in automated pipeline.                               | No interfaces provided by library, so unit testing can be complex. Complex types of testing seem possible due to independency of a solution.                                                                                                                                              | Potentially possible to perform unit testing as all types are .NET common. Complex types of testing can be non-trivial as would require CLI on a pipeline machine. | No interfaces provided by library, so unit testing can be complex. Complex types of testing can be non-trivial as would require CLI on a pipeline machine. |
| Documentation quality               | Detailed documentation as well as interfaces definition.                                                                                                                                         | Documentation is not enough detailed, complex examples are missing. Github issues are not available. Interfaces definition is available as well as developer portal with asked questions (but the amount of questions is small).                                                          | Documentation is detailed and well defined. GitHub issues are available as well as CLI definition.                                                                 | Minimal documentation that is limited with the only one page. Interface definitions are available.                                                         |
| Community support                   | Great amount of articles as well as community support via GitHub issues.                                                                                                                         | Community forum that makes possible to iText developers to answer questions in a form of articles. There is no information about answering speed and the amount of questions/answers is limited. No other community support except of general-purpose forums (as StackOverflow) is found. | Great community support for a based Wkhtmltopdf library. Available GitHub issues and dedicated articles.                                                           | No real community support as the solution is not open-source.                                                                                              |
