## Investigated tools

> Please note: final comparison table will include only tools that were not rejected during investigation.

- .NET
  - :white_check_mark: [SelectPDF](https://selectpdf.com/)
  - :x: [PdfSharp](https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp) - it is in preview and requires some custom code or extension to perform transformation of HTML to PDF (community-proposed extension HtmlRenderer is not maintained anymore).
  - :white_check_mark: [IronPdf](https://ironpdf.com/)
  - :x: [DinkToPdf](https://github.com/rdvojmoc/DinkToPdf) - the package is outdated: latest update 18.2017.
  - :white_check_mark: [iTextSharp](https://github.com/itext/itextsharp)
  - :x: [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) - CLI that requires us to start additional process on a host. Besides there is a dependency on Qt WebKit.
  - :x: [PDFSharpCore](https://github.com/ststeiger/PdfSharpCore) - community-driven fork of PDFSharp that was transferred to a .NET Core. As well as the original library requires additional functionality to perform transformation.
  - :white_check_mark: [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf-framework/net/html-to-pdf)
  - :white_check_mark: [DynamicPDF](https://www.dynamicpdf.com/)
  - :white_check_mark: [PuppeteerSharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp)
- Node.js
  - :x: [html-pdf](https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf) - package is deprecated.
  - :grey_question: [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) - depends on a headless browser. It requires further investigation.
  - :x: [html2pdf.js](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js) - fully client-side library.
