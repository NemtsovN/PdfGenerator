## Notes

- Converts HTML string to a PDF object.
- The resulted PDF object object can be saved to a file, to a stream, to a memory buffer or to a HTTP response.
- Allows us to modify document and its properties:
  - Set pdf page settings (page size, page orientation, page margins)
  - Set pdf document properties
  - Set pdf viewer preferences
  - Set pdf security (passwords, permissions)
  - Custom headers and footers
  - Support for html in headers and footers

### Concerns

- Free license exists, but it is limited up to 5 pages in a single document. [License](https://selectpdf.com/community-edition/)
- Seems that library fully depends on some Windows assets and can be run only on Windows machine (information is based on official website).
- No NuGet package source code found.

## Outcome

Seems to be a bad candidate due to mentioned concerns.
