## General

PDFsharp is a .NET library for processing PDF file. You create PDF pages using drawing routines known from GDI+. Almost anything that can be done with GDI+ will also work with PDFsharp. Only basic text layout is supported by PDFsharp, and page breaks are not created automatically. The same drawing routines can be used for screen, PDF, or meta files.

## Notes

N/A

### Concerns

- Preview version of .NET 6 migration
- 69 starts on a GitHub
- Last update 2 month ago
- Small amount of documentation
- Is not able to generate PDF based on HTML, so should be used in conjunction with HtmlRenderer. This one is [not maintained for now](https://github.com/ArthurHub/HTML-Renderer).

## Outcome

Seems to be a bad candidate due to mentioned concerns.
